These scripts provide an example of using a certificate to authenticate against Azure AD to perform management operations against Azure's Resource Manager API. 

For a full description of the script and how it works, please refer to the [accompanying blog post](http://https://brentdacodemonkey.wordpress.com/?p=937&preview=true).

These scripts steal/borrow heavily from the great work done by [Keith Mayer](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/keithmayer/). You can also find Keith's original version [here](https://github.com/robotechredmond/Azure-PowerShell-Snippets/blob/master/Azure%20RM%20-%20Key%20Vault%20with%20Service%20Principal%20cert-based%20auth%20using%20Enterprise%20CA%20certs.ps1).
